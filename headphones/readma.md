# 🎧 Headphones - ALX HTML & CSS Project

> 🚧 **Status:** Work in Progress  
> This project is currently in development as part of the ALX Software Engineering Program. Final updates will be pushed before the deadline.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves building a responsive and accessible landing page for a product (headphones) using **only HTML and CSS** — no JavaScript or external CSS frameworks allowed.

The goal is to recreate a professional web design provided via **Figma**, following a pixel-perfect approach, while ensuring proper structure, responsiveness, and accessibility.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Replicate the provided Figma design with high visual accuracy.
- Write clean, semantic HTML markup.
- Style the page using modern CSS practices (Flexbox, Grid, media queries).
- Ensure responsiveness across all screen sizes, including mobile and tablet.
- Maintain strong accessibility features for all users.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)
- Figma (design reference)
- Fonts:
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - [Spin-Cycle-OT](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/spin-cycle-ot)

## 📐 Design Rules

- ✅ **Responsive Layout:** The mobile version is triggered when screen width ≤ 480px.
- ✅ **Max Width:** Main content should not exceed 1000px and must be horizontally centered.
- ✅ **Link Hover/Active Color:** `#FF6565`
- ✅ **Button Hover/Active:** `opacity: 0.9`
- ✅ **Accessibility:** Semantic elements, descriptive `alt` text for images, and focus styles for keyboard users.
