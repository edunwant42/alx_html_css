## 🖥️ Project Description

The goal of this project is to replicate the **SmileSchool** one-page website using only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript or external libraries). The final result adheres closely to the original design, ensuring pixel-perfect layout and styling.

The web page includes the following sections:

- ✅ Header & Banner (Hero section with logo and CTA)
- 💬 Quotes (Testimonials from learners)
- 🎥 Video List (Popular tutorials)
- 🎓 Membership (Features of free membership)
- ❓ FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
- 🔗 Footer (With logo and social links)

All code is semantic, responsive, and accessible.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, I am able to:

- Explain what CSS is and how it styles web content
- Apply styles via inline, internal, and external CSS
- Use classes, IDs, and various CSS selectors appropriately
- Calculate and compare CSS specificity
- Understand and apply the CSS box model (margin, padding, border, content)
- Explain how browsers render and style HTML documents
